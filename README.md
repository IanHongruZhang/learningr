Learning R
==========

R is a very powerful and flexible statistics package and programming language.

This repository contains a number of 'howto' files aimed to providing an introduction to R and some os its possibilities.

Two other great sites for learning R are:
- [OpenIntro statistics](http://openintro.org/stat/labs.php) with a number of good statistics 'labs' in R
- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net) with explanations and sample code for a wide array of applications

To install R and RStudio, please see [lab 0 of the OpenIntro statistics book](http://openintro.org/download.php?file=os2_lab_00A&referrer=/stat/labs.php).
